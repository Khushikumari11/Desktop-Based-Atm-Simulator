# Desktop-Based ATM Simulator

Welcome to the Desktop-Based ATM Simulator project repository! This project is a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system designed to run on desktop computers. It provides users with a virtual environment to perform various banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash, checking balances, transferring funds, and more.

## Project Overview

The Desktop-Based ATM Simulator project aims to replicate the functionality of a real ATM system in a desktop application. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with banking services, allowing users to perform common transactions without the need for physical ATMs or visiting bank branches.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login system to authenticate users and protect their banking information.
- **Account Management:** Users can view account balances, transaction histories, and perform account-related actions such as changing PINs.
- **Cash Withdrawal:** Users can withdraw cash from their accounts using predefined withdrawal amounts or custom amounts.
- **Fund Transfer:** Transfer funds between accounts within the same bank or to external accounts at other banks.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Check account balances and view transaction histories for tracking financial activities.
- **Secure Transactions:** All transactions are encrypted and authenticated to ensure data integrity and user privacy.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions for optimal user experience.
